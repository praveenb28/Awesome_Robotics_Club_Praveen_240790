This project is exciting because it transforms a regular chessboard into an interactive, smart system using simple circuits and efficient matrix scanning. It detects moves in real time with minimal wiring and cost, making it both practical and affordable. The design is expandable — I can add LEDs, sounds. It’s a great hands-on way to apply electronics and programming skills while keeping it fun and creative. Plus, the instant human-machine interaction makes the experience even more engaging!
